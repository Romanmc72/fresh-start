# Headless

These are the init and bash profile settings for the typical headless server that I will install on my home network. There are other directories that contain specific scripts for specific types of servers that I would want to run, but this is the common set of tools and utilities to install regardless of which server I am setting up so that it looks and feels the same no matter which one I shell into.
